        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Jellied eels are an iconic dish with a rich history dating back to London, Engalnd, where they once were a street food sensation. This recipe offers a glimpse into this Old World tradition with a fresh twist. This gastronomic British masterpiece takes about 45-50 minutes to prepare. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fresh eels</li>
            <li>Parsley and pimentos (for flavoring)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Gelatine granules</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by cleaning the eels, ensuring that you remove the guts. Cut the eels into portions, making them manageable for cooking.</li>
            <li>To ensure safety, stun the eels so they are ready to be worked on. This step ensures that the eels won't move and make the process hazardous.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, add a bouquet garni of parsley and pimentos to flavor the water. This infusion of herbs imparts a unique taste and aroma to the dish.</li>
            <li>Bring the water to a boil, and add the eels. The cooking time will vary depending on the nature of the eel. Winter eels may take longer to cook (about 45-50 minutes) to achieve a softer flesh.</li>
            <li>During the cooking process, occasionally skim off any sediment and fat that rises to the surface of the water.</li>
            <li>Towards the end of the cooking, add salt for seasoning. This step ensures that your jellied eels are perfectly seasoned and balanced.</li>
            <li>Once the eels are thoroughly cooked, carefully remove them from the pot, allowing them to cool.</li>
            <li>Add gelatine granules to the cooking liquid, suspending it with salt to create the signature jellied texture.</li>
            <li>Place the eels in bowls and pour the jellied cooking liquid over them. Seal the bowls with lids and allow them to rest for about a day. During this time, the gelatine will set, and the eels will slowly float to the top, creating the desired consistency.</li>
            <li>To serve, take a piece of jellied eel from the bowl. You can enjoy it as it is or add a splash of non-brewed vinegar for an extra layer of flavor.</li>

        </ol>

        <h2>Cooking Tips</h2>
        <p>Jellied eels are traditionally served cold, but you can let them reach a slightly warmer room temperature for enhanced flavor.</p>
        <p>The dish pairs wonderfully with a refreshing beverage, making it an ideal choice for snacking or a light meal.</p>
        <p>Experiment with your preferred seasonings or condiments to personalize the flavor to your liking.        </p>
