        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a simple mushroom pizza with spinach and mozarella. It only takes 15 minutes to prepare and will come out as a 12-inch pizza.</p>
        <p>That does not make it any less scrumptious!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (12 inch) pre-baked pizza crust</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil or to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh spinach, rinsed and dried</li>
            <li>8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place pizza crust on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together olive oil and sesame oil. Brush onto pre-baked pizza crust, covering the entire surface. Stack spinach leaves, then cut lengthwise into 1/2-inch strips; scatter evenly over crust. Cover pizza with shredded mozzarella, and top with sliced mushrooms.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted and edges are crisp.</li>
        </ol>
